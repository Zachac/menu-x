# Menu-x
Fork of the [bundle-example-input-events](https://github.com/RanvierMUD/bundle-example-input-events). To make it more robust and extendable.

## Purpose
This bundle is designed to provide charachter creation, account management, and command processing functionality to ranvier instances. As well as to provide a safe and extendable input-event framework for other bundles to use to modify & extend the charachter creation & initialization flow.
